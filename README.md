Number Guesser Game in C++
Overview
The Number Guesser Game is a simple command-line game written in C++ where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the program provides feedback, guiding the player on whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

Features
Random number generation between 1 and 100.
Continuous feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
Displays the total number of attempts once the correct number is guessed.
Simple, intuitive command-line interface.
How to Play
The program will randomly select a number between 1 and 100.
You (the player) will input your guess into the console.
The game will tell you whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Keep guessing until you find the correct number!
Once guessed correctly, the game will display the number of attempts taken.
